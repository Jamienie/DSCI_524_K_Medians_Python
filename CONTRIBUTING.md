# Contributing
---------------

### How to Contribute
1. Fork the master repository
2. Clone the forked repository to your computer locally `git clone <forked_repo_URL>`
3. Link the master and forked repository `git remote add upstream <original_repo_URL>`
4. Send pull requests from your forked repository to the master repository
5. A team mate who did not send the pull request will merge the request
    - If a teammate feels the pull request should not be merged, schedule a team meeting with the team to discuss

### Communication
To ensure open and transparent communication create an issue in the master repository. When there are task oriented issues (like TA feedback) before working on the task add a comment assigning the task to yourself.
General items like scheduling meetings can be done via our private Slack channel. If you see a bug or typo either create an issue so the teammate responsible for the file is aware or fix the issue yourself and send a pull request.

### Commit Messages
When adding new files or making changes to existing files write simple and descriptive commit messages.
- have one commit message per task
- adding new files the commit message should contain the title of the file and the general purpose if the title does not provide this
- updating existing files the commit message should contain the file title, the changes and why (if applicable)
